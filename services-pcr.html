    <div class="my-5">
      <p>Digital PCR (dPCR) has emerged as a leading technique for the precise quantification of biologics due to its
        unmatched sensitivity, precision, and accuracy. At Alta Analytical, we harness the power of the QuantStudio
        Absolute Q Digital PCR System, ensuring that our clients benefit from state-of-the-art technology known for its
        reliability and performance. This platform enables us to quantify nucleic acids or target sequences with
        exceptional sensitivity, a key aspect in maintaining the quality and consistency of biologic products.</p>
      <p>Adherence to regulatory standards is paramount. When utilizing dPCR methods for releasing biologics, it's
        essential to strictly follow regulatory guidelines, validation procedures, and Good Manufacturing Practices
        (GMP). Given the unique nature of each biologic product and therapeutic approach, specialized method validation
        and optimization are crucial.</p>
      <p>The landscape of biologic release testing is ever-evolving. With continuous advancements in technology and
        shifting regulatory guidelines, staying informed and aligned with the latest best practices in dPCR application
        is a commitment we uphold for our clients.</p>
